# Project Plan

**Last Updated:** {current_date}

## High Priority

*   **Instagram Integration:** Develop a feature to post directly to Instagram from the `wp-admin/edit` page for a specific post. This will involve a "Post to Instagram" button that opens a modal displaying all images attached to the post. This will initially be built within its own directory in the theme and later extracted into a private plugin.
*   **Remote Login - Registration:** Add a registration option to the existing remote login system, allowing users to create accounts directly from post content.
*   **Complete Event Import System Refactor:** Implement the detailed plan outlined in `extrachill-custom/events-scraping/event-import-refactor-plan.md`. This includes migrating to Action Scheduler, implementing detailed logging, creating admin interfaces for logs and settings, standardizing event data, and refactoring all import sources.

## Medium Priority

*   **Homepage - extrachill.link Feature:** Add a section to the homepage featuring extrachill.link, our free link-in-bio tool tied into the Extra Chill community.

## Low Priority

*   **Theme Renaming & Cleanup:** Gradually rename the theme directory and remove all remaining remnants of ColorMag-specific code as the codebase is worked on.
*   **Co-Authors Plus Migration:** Plan and execute a migration away from the Co-Authors Plus plugin.
*   **WP-PageNavi Migration:** Plan and execute a migration away from the WP-PageNavi plugin.

## Known Bugs

*   **Comment System:** The current comment system needs review and potential rework, particularly how it integrates with community user data and displays author links.

## Ideas

*   Explore further enhancements to the bbPress forum integration (e.g., investigate `forum-search.php`, `extrachill-upvotes.php`, `recent-activity-feed.php`).
*   Review and optimize WooCommerce integration.
*   Further investigate `extrachill-custom/community-integration/extrachill-event-submission.php` to determine its purpose and relation to The Events Calendar or community features.
